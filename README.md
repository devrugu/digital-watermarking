# digital-watermarking
This project is for protecting the data authenticity of images.
I used Ping Wah Wong's algorithm for watermark insertion and extraction.[1]
The only difference of the program from the Wong's algorithm is that it does not include the public key encryption part but I will add that part in the future.

Below image shows the watermark insertion algorithm:
